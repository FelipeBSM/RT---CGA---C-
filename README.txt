Here is the link to my presentation video:

In the video, I discuss the results obtained, what I aimed to achieve, what I managed to do, and the workarounds I used.

In my project, there is an option to generate code for Grade A or Grade B, as requested. The filters from GA are also functional in GB, and there's an option to configure this as well.

The files generated by the program are in .ppm format, but to make image viewing easier, they were converted to PNG. To see the images obtained, please open the 'result' folder.

Thank you for your attention! Best regards, Felipe
